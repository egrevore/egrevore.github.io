    <h1>EGREVORE TRADING CARDS</h1>
    <br>
    <h2><a href="cards.html">Egrevore Base Set</a></h2>&nbsp;<h2><a href="Remilia.html">Remilia Promo Set</a></h2>
    <br>
    <p align="justify">To be a part of Egrevore is to be a part of a collective, just the same as to participate in the World Wide Web. To collect is to pay tribute to the driving impulse of human spirit. Twenty thousand years ago, a hunter wears a necklace made of fangs from every animal he kills which will be with him until the day he dies, his wife looks down at a basket of berries, nuts, and mushrooms which will be gone the same day she gathered it.</p>
    <br>
    <p align="justify">A fisherman's seashells make the same comforting clinks in the jostling of his boat as the runes carved from bone in the satchel of the shaman. Centuries later a soldier will be buried with dog tags, empty cartridges, a Zippo lighter, and a few lucky coins. His son has a book of stamps in his room. His son collects baseball cards. His son collects pogs. His son collects YuGiOh cards. So it goes.</p>
    <br>
    <p align="justify">This is a collection of faces and names. Many you will recognize, some you may not. This collection hides in the recesses of your brain and in the saved tabs on your browser. Egrevore has created an opportunity to make real the ephemeral collection of the online, people of significance in internet history made into something you can touch, hold, keep, lose, forget, treasure, destroy, or pass on as you see fit. It's up to you to collect them all.</p>
